# KWANDO: Monte Carlo Simulation Dashboard

KWANDO is a simple, open-source dashboard for Monte Carlo simulations using your own CSV data. It helps you forecast delivery dates and team capacity using real historical data. Built with Python and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/).

## Features

- **Forecast Completion Dates**: Predict when a set number of work items will be done
- **Capacity Planning**: Calculate how many items can be completed in a period
- **Data Upload**: Use your own CSV files or sample data
- **Web Interface**: Dashboard with real-time calculations
- **Percentiles**: View percentiles (70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%) for confidence levels
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: 100% open source, runs locally or online

## Quick Start

To run locally:

1. Install Python 3.12+
2. Install the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) package manager
3. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rodbv/kwando.git
   cd kwando
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   uv sync
   ```
5. Start the dashboard:
   ```sh
   just run
   # or
   uv run panel serve src/dashboard.py --show
   ```

## Usage

- Select or add your CSV file in the `data/` directory.
- The CSV must have at least these columns:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each work item
  - `start_date`: Start date of the work item in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `end_date`: End date of the work item in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Use the dashboard to:
  - Forecast when a set number of items will be done
  - Forecast how many items can be completed in a period
